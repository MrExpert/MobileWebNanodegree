# MobileWebNanodegree

The Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree program is comprised of advanced web development curriculum organized into three parts and three projects. Each project you build will be an opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned. Your completed projects become part of a career portfolio that will demonstrate your mastery of mobile web development.

# Part   1:   Building   Accessible   and   Responsive   Web   Apps

## 3 Courses and 1 Project
## 1.Responsive   Web   Design Fundamentals
➔ In   this   course   you'll   learn   the   fundamentals   of   responsive   web design   with   Google's   Pete   LePage!   You'll   create   your   own responsive   web   page   that   works   well   on   any   device   -   phone, tablet,   desktop   or   anything   in   between.
➔ You’ll   start   by   exploring   what   makes   a   site   responsive   and   how some   common   responsive   design   patterns   work   across different   devices.   From   there,   you’ll   learn   how   to   create   your own   responsive   layout   using   the   viewport   tag   and   CSS   media queries.   As   you   proceed,   you’ll   experiment   with   major   and minor   breakpoints,   and   optimizing   text   for   reading.

## 2.Responsive   Images

➔ Did   you   know   that   images   account   for   more   than   60%   of   the bytes   on   average   needed   to   load   a   web   page?
➔ In   this   course   you   will   learn   how   to   work   with   images   on   the modern   web,   so   that   your   images   look   great   and   load   quickly   on any   device.
➔ Along   the   way,   you   will   pick   up   a   range   of   skills   and   techniques to   smoothly   integrate   responsive   images   into   your   development workflow.   By   the   end   of   the   course,   you   will   be   developing   with images   that   adapt   and   respond   to   different   viewport   sizes   and usage   scenarios.

## 3.Web   Accessibility

➔ In   this   course   you’ll   get   hands-on   experience   making   web applications   accessible.   You’ll   understand   when   and   why   users need   accessibility.   Then   you’ll   dive   into   the   “how”:   making   a page   work   properly   with   screen   readers,   and   managing   input focus   (e.g.   the   highlight   you   see   when   tabbing   through   a   form.) You’ll   understand   what   “semantics”   and   “semantic   markup” mean   for   web   pages   and   add   ARIA   markup   to   enable   navigating the   interface   with   a   range   of   assistive   devices.   Finally,   you’ll learn   styling   techniques   that   help   users   with   partial   vision navigate   your   pages   easily   and   reliably.

## Project:   Restaurant   Reviews   App—Stage   One

➔ In   this   Nanodegree   program,   you   will   build   a   Restaurant   Reviews   App.   To   do   this,   you   will   incrementally convert   a   static   webpage   to   a   mobile-ready   web   application   in   three   stages.   In   Stage   One,   you   will   take   a static   design   that   lacks   accessibility   and   convert   the   design   to   be   responsive   on   different   sized   displays   and accessible   for   screen   reader   use.

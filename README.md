## Part1 :   Building   Accessible   and   Responsive   Web   Apps

### 3 Courses and 1 Project
#### 1.Responsive Web Design Fundamentals
➔ In   this   course   you'll   learn   the   fundamentals   of   responsive   web design   with   Google's   Pete   LePage!   You'll   create   your   own responsive   web   page   that   works   well   on   any   device   -   phone, tablet,   desktop   or   anything   in   between.
➔ You’ll   start   by   exploring   what   makes   a   site   responsive   and   how some   common   responsive   design   patterns   work   across different   devices.   From   there,   you’ll   learn   how   to   create   your own   responsive   layout   using   the   viewport   tag   and   CSS   media queries.   As   you   proceed,   you’ll   experiment   with   major   and minor   breakpoints,   and   optimizing   text   for   reading.

#### 2.Responsive Images

➔ Did   you   know   that   images   account   for   more   than   60%   of   the bytes   on   average   needed   to   load   a   web   page?
➔ In   this   course   you   will   learn   how   to   work   with   images   on   the modern   web,   so   that   your   images   look   great   and   load   quickly   on any   device.
➔ Along   the   way,   you   will   pick   up   a   range   of   skills   and   techniques to   smoothly   integrate   responsive   images   into   your   development workflow.   By   the   end   of   the   course,   you   will   be   developing   with images   that   adapt   and   respond   to   different   viewport   sizes   and usage   scenarios.

#### 3.Web Accessibility

➔ In   this   course   you’ll   get   hands-on   experience   making   web applications   accessible.   You’ll   understand   when   and   why   users need   accessibility.   Then   you’ll   dive   into   the   “how”:   making   a page   work   properly   with   screen   readers,   and   managing   input focus   (e.g.   the   highlight   you   see   when   tabbing   through   a   form.) You’ll   understand   what   “semantics”   and   “semantic   markup” mean   for   web   pages   and   add   ARIA   markup   to   enable   navigating the   interface   with   a   range   of   assistive   devices.   Finally,   you’ll learn   styling   techniques   that   help   users   with   partial   vision navigate   your   pages   easily   and   reliably.

#### Project: Restaurant Reviews App Stage One

➔ In   this   Nanodegree   program,   you   will   build   a   Restaurant   Reviews   App.   To   do   this,   you   will   incrementally convert   a   static   webpage   to   a   mobile-ready   web   application   in   three   stages.   In   Stage   One,   you   will   take   a static   design   that   lacks   accessibility   and   convert   the   design   to   be   responsive   on   different   sized   displays   and accessible   for   screen   reader   use.

### Part 2: Building Offline Capable Web Apps

### 4 Courses and 1 Project

#### 1. Asynchronous JavaScript Requests

➔ This   course   covers   everything   a   developer   needs   to   know   to asynchronously   send   and   receive   data   in   their   web   applications. You'll   dive   into   how   asynchronous   requests   work   by   using   the XHR   object   to   create   and   send   asynchronous   requests   for   image and   news   article   data.   Then,   you'll   see   how   you   can   perform async   requests   more   easily   using   third-party   libraries   and   APIs like   jQuery's   Ajax   and   the   Fetch   API.

#### 2. ES6 JavaScript Improved

➔ ECMAScript   6,   or   ES6,   has   brought   about   a   ton   of   changes   to   the JavaScript   programming   language.   In   this   course,   you'll   explore those   changes   to   learn   about   the   latest   features   and improvements   to   the   language   including   new   keywords,   arrow functions,   the   Class   syntax,   Promises,   and   so   much   more. Discover   how   much   cleaner   and   more   concise   your   JavaScript code   can   be!

#### 3. Offline Web Applications

➔ This   course   is   focused   squarely   on   user   experience,   and   seeks to   show   developers   how   thinking   offline-first   is   the   best   way   to ensure   that   applications   perform   their   best   in   all   scenarios,   not just   ideal   ones.   You'll   learn   to   recognize   the   differences   between good,   poor,   intermittent,   and   missing   connectivity   for   your users,   and   master   how   to   make   applications   that   navigate   these conditions   with   ease.

#### 4. Web Tooling and Automation

➔ In   this   course,   you’ll   learn   how   to   setup   your   development,   get super   productive   during   daily   work   and   iteration,   prevent yourself   and   your   site   from   disasters   and   save   a   lot   of   time   and effort   with   automatic   optimization   and   automation.   Finally,   you’ll learn   how   to   do   all   this   while   being   confident   your   code   runs   on a   multitude   of   devices   in   the   real   world.

#### 5. Project 2: Restaurant Reviews App Stage Two

In   this   Nanodegree   program,   you   will   build   a   Restaurant   Reviews   App.   To   do   this,   you   will   incrementally convert   a   static   webpage   to   a   mobile-ready   web   application   in   three   stages.   In   Stage   Two,   you   will   be   given   a back-end   server   and   the   code   from   Stage   One   and   add   the   ability   to   read   JSON   from   the   server   and   display this   data   in   the   app,   store   data   in   a   database   for   offline   use,   and   meet   a   site   performance   target.

### Part 3: Building Performant Web Apps

### 2 Courses and 1 Project

#### 1. Client Server Communication

➔ We   use   websites   all   the   time,   but   how   does   clicking   a   link   in   your browser   or   typing   in   a   URL   in   the   address   bar   get   you   to   a website?   How   does   the   server   know   what   information   you're looking   for   or   how   to   send   you   that   information   once   it's   figured that   out?   How   can   you   protect   your   users   from   attackers?
➔ This   course   will   guide   you   through   how   a   client   communicates with   a   server.   You'll   learn   about   HTTP's   request   and   response cycle,   dig   into   HTTP   headers   and   verbs,   distinguish   HTTP/1   from HTTP/2   capabilities,   all   while   experiencing   the   importance   of security   by   digging   into   the   details   of   HTTPS.   Throughout   the course,   you'll   learn   both   security   best   practices,   as   well   as   ways to   improve   the   performance   of   your   web   apps.   We'll   provide you   with   handcrafted   servers   where   you'll   diagnose   problematic server   setups,   issues   with   SSL   certificates,   and   even   have   a chance   to   hack   an   example   bank   website   to   transfer   funds.

#### 2. Browser Rendering Optimization

➔ Performance   matters   to   users.   Web   developers   need   to   build apps   that   react   quickly   and   render   smoothly.
➔ Google   performance   guru   Paul   Lewis   is   here   to   help   you   destroy jank   and   create   web   apps   that   maintain   60   frames   per   second performance.
➔ You'll   leave   this   course   with   the   tools   you   need   to   profile   apps and   identify   the   causes   of   jank.   You'll   explore   the   browser's rendering   pipeline   and   uncover   patterns   that   make   it   easy   to build   performant   apps.

#### 3. Project: Restaurant Reviews App Stage Three

In   this   Nanodegree   program,   you   will   build   a   Restaurant   Reviews   App.   To   do   this,   you   will   incrementally convert   a   static   webpage   to   a   mobile-ready   web   application   in   three   stages.   In   the   final   stage,   Stage   Three, you   will   advance   the   project   from   Stage   Two.   You   will   implement   login   and   review   submission   logic   on   the client   side,   add   search   capability   to   the   database   so   that   users   can   store   and   look   at   reviews,   and   leverage offline   capabilities   so   that   users   will   be   able   write   a   review   offline   or   mark   a   review   or   restaurant   as   a favorite   while   offline,   defer   it,   and   have   it   sent   to   the   server   when   it's   back   online.
